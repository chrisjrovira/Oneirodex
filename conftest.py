    the test's connection because Flask-SQLAlchemy's own `Session.get_bind`
    returns the app's default engine before it will honour a per-session
    `bind=`, so `db.session.configure(bind=...)` alone does not route here.

    Two things keep the SAVEPOINT model honest:

    * **The savepoint-restart listener** (SQLAlchemy's "Joining a Session into
      an External Transaction" recipe). A `db.session.commit()` inside a test —
      or Flask-SQLAlchemy's `teardown_appcontext` firing `db.session.remove()`
      when a nested `app_context()` / `test_request_context()` pops mid-test —
      RELEASEs the per-test SAVEPOINT. With nothing re-opening one, the session
      keeps a dangling savepoint reference and teardown's `.remove()` emits
      `ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT` against a name Postgres has already released
      (`InvalidSavepointSpecification`). `_restart_savepoint` re-arms a fresh
      nested transaction the moment the previous one ends, so exactly one
      per-test SAVEPOINT is always outstanding.

    * **Exception-safe teardown.** Even with the listener, a slow test that let
      Postgres hit `idle_in_transaction_session_timeout`, or any error inside
      `.remove()`, must not skip `transaction.rollback()` /
      `connection.close()`: an un-rolled-back outer transaction strands the
      connection `idle in transaction` holding row locks, and the next test's
      first write blocks on `lock_timeout` and fails — the cascade recorded in
      `docs/dev/test-harness-2026-09-10.md`. Every teardown step therefore runs
      under its own `try`, and the connection is closed no matter what.

# second OS thread pushing its own `app.app_context()`
# (`run_in_background`, `oneirodex/utils/background.py`) or a debounced digest
# flushed from a context nested inside another. `db_session` binds every app
# context onto ONE shared `Connection` object so a test-client request can see
# a test's own uncommitted rows; a second thread touching that same
# `Connection` concurrently is exactly the hazard `run_in_background` exists
# to avoid (a DBAPI connection is not thread-safe), and a nested context's own
# `teardown_appcontext` -> `.remove()` rolls back its `create_savepoint`
# savepoint, discarding what an even-more-nested context just committed into
# it. Neither is fixable with a smarter SAVEPOINT — these tests need a real
# session against the real engine.
#
# Rows committed here are real, so there is no rollback to lean on. Cleanup is
# a TRUNCATE scoped to the fixed, small set of tables the bucket-E tests
# actually touch — never a global, cross-test TRUNCATE. That is safe because
# these are the only tests that request this fixture and pytest runs them one
# at a time in one process: nothing else can be relying on those tables'

    with any product code that also lazily creates the row, without tripping the
    `global_settings_singleton` unique index. Mutate the returned object and
    commit for tests that need particular values on it.
