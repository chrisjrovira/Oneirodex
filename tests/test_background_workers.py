"""Background workers must not share the spawning request's session.

Six route handlers used to start daemon threads with
`@copy_current_request_context`. That hands the thread the request's context,
and Flask-SQLAlchemy scopes `db.session` to the application context — so the
worker and the request shared one `Session`, which is not thread-safe, while
the worker outlived the request by design (a library deletion walks every game
in the library).

The failure is the kind that shows up somewhere else entirely. It was first
caught in this suite: a leaked library-deletion worker was still deleting one
test's fixtures while later test files ran, producing ObjectDeletedError on
unrelated rows in unrelated files.

These tests pin the property that fixes it — a worker gets its own session —
rather than the mechanism, so a future refactor is free to change how as long
as the isolation holds.
