"""An interrupted setup must never brick the install.

`setup_submit` used to commit the admin user and then, in a *second*
transaction, advance the wizard to step 2. Anything failing in between — a
crash, a container restart, a dropped connection — left the pair of facts
"a user exists" and "still on step 1".

That combination is an unrecoverable redirect loop, not a cosmetic glitch:

    before_request  -> should_redirect_to_setup() is True (setup in progress)
                    -> get_setup_redirect_url() returns '/setup' for step 1
    GET /setup      -> not is_setup_required() and is_setup_in_progress()
                    -> redirect(get_setup_redirect_url()) -> '/setup'

Every route in the app redirects to /setup, and /setup redirects to itself.
There is no way out through the UI; it needs a database edit.

These tests pin both halves of the fix: the write is atomic now, and an install
already stranded in that state recovers instead of looping.
