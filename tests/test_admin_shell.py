#: How the brand mark is rendered, which is no longer a file reference.
#:
#: It used to be `oneirodex_mark.svg` in an <img src>. That raster bakes the
#: default green and a dark plate into the file, and an external SVG loaded
#: through <img> cannot read the page's custom properties — so on every preset
#: but the default the whole shell changed colour and the mark stayed green.
#: The mark is now painted: a `.od-brand-mark` element masked with a monochrome
#: silhouette and filled with var(--od-accent).
#:
#: Counting the *class* rather than a filename is the same guard one level up.
#: The comment below already argued that naming a location is what keeps
#: breaking this test; naming an asset turned out to have the same flaw, and
#: this is the second half of that lesson.

#: reference alone is hollow — it renders a blank box if either is missing.

#: Admin shell chrome — the components making up the persistent nav frame.
#: Deliberately a *category* rather than a filename: the mark moving between
#: chrome components stays green, which is the whole point of counting, while
#: it leaking into an ordinary page or vanishing from the frame does not.

def test_the_admin_brand_mark_is_rendered_by_exactly_one_chrome_component():
    """The mark has now moved twice, and each move broke this guard.

    It first asserted against base_admin.html, was repointed at `AdminTopNav`
    when admin bar one became React, then broke again when GT-B2 moved the
    brand to `AdminSideRail` — repeating it in the top bar was the duplication
    that made admin feel like two navs. Naming the file is what keeps breaking:
    each rewrite re-pinned a location, and the location is the part that
    changes. What the guard actually protects is that admin chrome renders the
    brand exactly once — never zero (a shell with no brand at all) and never
    twice (the GT-B2 duplication coming back). So count instead of naming, and
    a future move of the mark between chrome components stays green on its own.

    A third break, and the same lesson one level up: the mark stopped being a
    raster in an <img> and became a masked `.od-brand-mark` element, so it could
    follow the selected theme. Counting a *filename* re-pinned an asset the way
    the earlier versions re-pinned a location. The class is what "renders the
    brand" now means, so that is what is counted — with the glyph and the
    stylesheet checked separately, since a class whose mask or paint is missing
    renders an invisible box and would otherwise count as success.

    The count is scoped to chrome (`CHROME_STEM`). Counting across all of `src`
    was not the same guard: the mark could drop out of the rail and be picked up
    by any ordinary page, the total would still be one, and the shell would
    render with no brand at all — the zero case this is supposed to catch.
