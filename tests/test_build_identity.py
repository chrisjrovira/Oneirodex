"""What is running, and is it what shipped?

Before this there was no answer from inside the product: the version was a
literal, the Alembic revision was never read back, and no build stamp reached
the process. These cover the two properties that make the answer trustworthy --
one source for the version, and every field degrading to ``None`` rather than
taking the Ops poll down.
