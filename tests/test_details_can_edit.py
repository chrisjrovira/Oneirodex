"""The details payload must say whether the reader may edit (v11 follow-up).

`GameDetailsPage` has read `game.can_edit` since the PC cheats panel shipped —
for the cheats form, the mods panel and the headset-record editor — but the
payload never sent the field, so every one of those controls was gated on
`undefined`. Librarian or above, the same rule their routes apply.
