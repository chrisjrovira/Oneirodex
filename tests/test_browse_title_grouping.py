"""Copies of one title across systems collapse to a single browse row.

The grid shows one tile per row in one library, so a household holding a game on
three systems saw three unrelated tiles. Grouping happens inside the query —
Postgres computes the pairing key and `DISTINCT ON` picks the representative —
so the things most worth pinning are the ones a post-query dedupe would get
wrong: that the *count* still counts titles, and that a page stays full.
