"""The two-bar chrome must look identical in React and in Jinja (UIR-4).

Admin's page bodies are Jinja and the member SPA is React, and the two builds
cannot import from each other. So the *stylesheet* is the shared artifact and
both renderers emit the same class names against it.

That arrangement only holds if the class names stay in step. Renaming
`od-seg__item` in one place and not the other would not break either build, it
would just quietly make admin look different again — which is precisely the
drift this refresh exists to end. These tests fail instead.
