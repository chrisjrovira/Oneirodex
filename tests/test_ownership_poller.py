"""Linked store accounts must stay current, not sync once and rot (GT-B27).

`sync_steam_owned_games` always worked; nothing ever ran it a second time. So
linking a Steam account synced at the moment you linked it and was stale from
the next purchase onward — which makes a linked account no better than the CSV
import it was meant to improve on.

These pin the behaviours that make the poller safe to leave running unattended:
it respects the admin kill switch, it does not thrash a third-party API on our
users' keys, and one member's broken link does not stop everyone else's refresh.
