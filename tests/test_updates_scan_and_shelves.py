"""W28 — the member-facing update sweep, and the Latest Games / New Library split.

Two reported gaps, both about a surface that could only *read* state nobody
could produce:

* The Updates inbox lists titles a previous freshness probe found behind. The
  only ways to make a probe happen were per-title, the library multi-select, and
  an admin-only bulk refresh — so a member whose library had never been probed
  saw an empty inbox and no way to fill it. ``POST /api/updates/scan`` is the
  member's own sweep.
* "Latest Games" ordered by ``date_created`` — when a scan first wrote the row —
  so it answered "what did I import most recently" under a heading that promises
  new releases. It orders by release date now, and the question it used to
  answer has its own shelf.
