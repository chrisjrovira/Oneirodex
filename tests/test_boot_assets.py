"""An install should arrive with its fonts and firmware.

Both capabilities existed as scripts — `scripts/fetch-fonts.py` and
`scripts/import_bios.py` — and nothing called either. The result was a font
picker offering five faces and shipping none (`available_fonts()` honestly
reporting `installed: False` for each), and a populated local firmware folder
that the Emulators page still reported as empty.

The logic is now importable so boot can use it and the scripts stay the manual
path. These tests cover the importable half: no network, no database.
