"""The apply-theme endpoint is retired (W28).

This file used to assert the route existed, rejected anonymous callers and was
CSRF-protected. `POST /admin/themes/apply` set the calling admin's own
`preferences.theme` — the same write Preferences performs — from a second swatch
grid on the admin Themes page. Two surfaces writing one value could disagree
about what was selected, with nothing to say which had last won.

Nothing was lost by removing it: `UserPreferencesForm` builds its choices from
`get_installed_themes()`, so Preferences already lists uploaded packs as well as
the presets, and it is where font, icon pack and tile size are chosen too.

The tests now pin the retirement, on the same principle the file always had —
a route contract is worth asserting, and "gone" is a contract.

Kept free of database fixtures so this still runs when no test Postgres is up.
