"""Phase 3 of the security/legal playbook — image upload limits (S3, S4).

Three things were wrong on this route at once, and the middle one is the reason
the other two mattered:

* the size check read ``file.content_length``, which is 0 for an ordinary
  multipart upload, so it never fired;
* ``img.thumbnail()`` mutated a local and the route then wrote the *original*
  bytes, so the resize was dead code and oversized covers were stored whole;
* nothing bounded pixel count, so the resize was where a decompression bomb
  would have landed.

The resize assertion below is the one that would have caught the dead code:
it reads the file back off disk rather than trusting the 200.

See docs/strategy/security-legal-playbook.md (S3, S4).
