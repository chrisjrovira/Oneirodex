"""Installable member app — TC-2b thin seats and Quest headsets.

The pieces that have to be true together, or the app is not installable and
nothing says why:

* a manifest is *served* and *linked* from the shells,
* a service worker is served at the origin root with a root scope header,
* the worker caches nothing that belongs to a member,
* an installed window with no network lands on a page that holds no library
  data (the worker precaches it, and a precached shelf would be readable by
  whoever opens the browser next on a shared machine).
