"""The served theme must be reported when it is not the theme we shipped.

Theme CSS/JS only reaches `static/library/themes/` when an admin runs Reset
Themes. After any release that touches theme assets the product keeps serving
the previous copy, and nothing said so — the only symptom was "the fix didn't
work", which sends everyone to read the stylesheet rather than the copy step.

On the install these were written against, 36 of 85 tracked assets were behind
source and 3 had never been deployed at all — including od-shell.css, the entire
rail and shell stylesheet. Every CSS fix in that file had been invisible since
it was written.
