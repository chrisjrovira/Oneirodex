"""Generated covers must differ from each other (GT-B28 · UID-011).

Reported symptom: "every image looks the same". The palette *was* seeded per
title, but the composition never varied — every cover ran one fixed sequence
(gradient, bands, orbs, bezel, centred initials), so two games produced the
same picture in two colours.

Variety has to be structural. These assert that different titles get different
compositions, that a given title is stable across regenerations, and that the
gating actually removed the furniture which used to appear on everything.
