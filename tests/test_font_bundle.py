"""Theme fonts ship with the product; installing them must not need the network.

The regression this guards is a whole feature reading as broken: the font picker
lists five faces and reports `installed: False` for any whose file is absent, and
the only thing that ever wrote those files was a background download from
google/fonts run once at the end of first-run setup. A proxy, an air-gapped
host, an install already past setup, or a fetch that failed quietly all ended
with a picker offering five fonts and shipping none — with the remedy being a
script nobody knew to run.
