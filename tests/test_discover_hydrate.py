"""Discover hydration stays flat as shelves get deeper.

The point of `oneirodex.utils.discover_hydrate` is that the cost of building the
feed tracks the number of *shelves*, not the number of *tiles*. That property is
invisible in the payload — a feed built with one query per tile returns exactly
the same JSON as one built in a single batch — so nothing but a query count will
notice when it regresses.

It regressed once already, which is why this exists: the serializer grew a
cover-image lookup, three lazy relationships and a companion-presence check, each
correct on its own and each per tile.
