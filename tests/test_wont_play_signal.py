"""Saying "Won't play" has to mean something (INSP-4, with INSP-21 folded in).

The status has been recordable for a long time and **nothing read it**: a
member could mark a game Won't play and Discover would keep offering it, which
looks like not listening. It was also missing from the batch allow-list, so the
multi-select bar could set four of the five statuses and silently refused the
fifth.
