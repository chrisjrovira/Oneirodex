"""Agent-harness files must never be tracked, whatever agent or model is in use.

The human ruled on 2026-09-17: ``CLAUDE.md`` / ``AGENTS.md`` (how an agent is run
against this repo -- seats, skills, ship procedure) and the ``.claude/`` /
``.cursor/`` kit stay off GitHub. PR #115 had tracked the two files on the
theory that a fresh clone needed project instructions; the conventions a
contributor actually needs now live in ``CONTRIBUTING.md`` instead.

This test is the guard the ruling asked for. It reads the *index*, not the
working tree, so it fails the moment any agent stages one of these paths --
including a future one that has never read the ruling.

Agent *handoff briefs* are the same class (PR #140, 2026-09-18, tried to route
one into ``docs/HANDOFF.md`` because the root ``/*.md`` ignore swallowed it).
They describe how an agent is run -- plan files, memories, queue mechanics --
and name the operator's own hosts and containers. They live in ``docs/_private/``
(ignored) like the 2026-09-01 brief before them.

Exempt: ``.cursor/environment.json`` / ``install.sh`` / ``start.sh`` -- Cursor's
cloud-agent *environment* bootstrap (a Postgres install and a generated key),
which contain no agent instructions and which the cloud agent cannot clone
without. Add to the exemption only with the same justification.
