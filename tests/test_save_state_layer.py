"""Save-state layer (Phase 4): resume on tiles, slot vocabulary, the shell's prompt.

Storage existed (`EmulatorSave`, `/api/games/<uuid>/saves`); what was missing
was the member-facing half — a tile that says *Resume*, a shell that asks
before loading, an auto-state on quit, named quick saves. The backend bits are
behavioural tests; the shell bits are source assertions, because a missing
resume bar still renders a playable room and nothing else would notice.
