"""The shipped avatars must stay recolourable.

The seven stock avatars are flat SVGs served as ``<img>``. They cannot inherit
``currentColor`` and cannot read a CSS custom property, so on every preset other
than the default they rendered in the default theme's green while the rest of
the UI changed around them — reported as "default avatars should have theme
ready versions for each one".

They are generated per preset instead, the same way ``od-tokens.css`` is:
:func:`_write_preset_avatars` substitutes three known source colours for the
preset's own. Straight substitution is only safe while the source art *stays*
inside those three colours, and nothing about editing an SVG makes that
obvious — a designer adding a highlight would produce art that silently
survives into all nine themes unrecoloured, and the only symptom would be one
avatar looking wrong on one theme.

So the palette is a contract, and this is the test that enforces it.
