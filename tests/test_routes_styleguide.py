"""Coverage guards for the design-system styleguide page (GT-A6).

The styleguide is the visual contract for the primitives: it renders the GT
button family and the bridged Bootstrap family side by side so a divergence is
visible instead of arriving as a bug report. That only works if it stays
complete, so these tests assert two things a stylesheet edit can quietly break:

  * every ``.od-btn`` modifier defined in od-primitives.css is rendered here
  * every token scale the page advertises actually exists in od-tokens.css

Both read the real theme source rather than a fixture list, so adding a variant
without showing it fails rather than silently shipping an unrepresented one.

        request is redirected to `/setup` and never reaches the login gate this
        asserts on. Locally it passed because the shared test database always
        had a user left behind by an earlier test; on CI, which starts clean and

        `assert 'login' in '/setup'`.

        to accept `/setup` as well would have gone green while testing nothing —
        a styleguide with its auth decorator removed would still redirect to the
