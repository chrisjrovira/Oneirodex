# gametheca/static/vendor/THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md is the inventory and carries the
# copyright lines read out of the shipped files themselves. This fetches the
# upstream licence texts so each directory is self-describing too.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/fetch-vendor-licenses.sh
#
# Safe to re-run: existing files are overwritten with the same upstream text.
# Needs network. WebRetro is deliberately absent — its licence is unconfirmed
# (see THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md) and this script does not guess.
