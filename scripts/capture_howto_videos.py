"""
Narrated how-to videos for the docs — one per feature, with an AI voice.

Each section is a **worked example** scripted as steps. A step is a line of
narration plus the thing on screen that line describes. The recorder:

1. synthesises every line first (Microsoft neural voices via `edge-tts`),
   measures each clip, and caches it under `.artifacts/howto-tts/`;
2. records the section in Playwright, holding on each step for at least as
   long as its narration runs, so the voice and the pointer stay together;
3. draws an app-styled title card at the start, an outro card at the end and
   a lower-third caption for every line — in the theme's own tokens, inside
   the page, so any player shows them;
4. muxes the narration onto the recording with the bundled ffmpeg
   (`imageio-ffmpeg`) into an H.264 / AAC `.mp4`, writes a WebVTT track, a
   poster frame and a transcript, and regenerates `howto/README.md`.

Honesty rules carry over from the silent recorder this replaces. A step the
section is *about* is `required` and aborts the section if the UI cannot do
it — no clip is written. An optional step whose affordance is missing is
dropped from both picture and narration rather than narrated over nothing.

Requires a running capture instance (`python scripts/serve_capture.py`):

    python scripts/capture_howto_videos.py               # every section
    python scripts/capture_howto_videos.py library chat  # a subset
    python scripts/capture_howto_videos.py --list

Env: CAPTURE_BASE_URL · CAPTURE_USER · CAPTURE_PASS · CAPTURE_VOICE
(default en-US-AndrewMultilingualNeural) · CAPTURE_KEEP_WEBM=1 to keep the
raw recording next to the mp4.

README_HEAD = """# How-to videos

One short narrated clip per feature, each a **worked example**: open the
thing, use it, show the result. An AI voice (Microsoft neural, via
`edge-tts`) reads a script that is timed to what is on screen; the same lines
are burned in as a lower-third caption and shipped as a WebVTT track next to
each file, so the clips work with sound off and with a screen reader's
transcript.

Recorded by [`scripts/capture_howto_videos.py`](../../../../scripts/capture_howto_videos.py)
against a local capture instance ([`scripts/serve_capture.py`](../../../../scripts/serve_capture.py))
— see [CAPTURE.md](../../../assets/readme/CAPTURE.md). The prose guides say
*why*; the clip shows *where*.

> GitHub plays `.mp4` files in place: click a poster to open the file page.
"""

README_GAPS = """
## What these clips honestly do not show

The capture instance is seeded with the five **legal free sample ROMs** and
no store keys, so:

- **Related media, screenshots, trailers** — no sample title has any, so the
  popup and the lightbox are not demonstrated. They render only when a game
  actually has entries.
- **Browser play itself** — the WebRetro cores are fetched at first boot and
  the capture box keeps outbound traffic off, so the Play button is shown but
  not pressed.
- **Voice** — LiveKit is off in the capture env; the Voice and Screenshare
  buttons are shown, no session is joined.
- **IGDB metadata, release dates, store deals in Discover** — whatever the
  instance could fetch without keys is what you see; an empty calendar or
  news page is the honest state of a keyless install.
- **Fonts** — the picker appears, but the era faces switch visibly only where
  the operator has installed them.

These are gaps in the *sample data*, not in the product. They are listed so
nobody re-records expecting different footage, and so no clip is ever staged
with invented content to fill them.

## Re-recording

```bash
python scripts/serve_capture.py                 # bring up the capture instance
python scripts/capture_howto_videos.py          # all sections
python scripts/capture_howto_videos.py library chat-spaces   # just these
```

A section whose UI cannot do what it is about writes **no file at all**
rather than a clip that narrates over nothing. Voice: `CAPTURE_VOICE`
(any `edge-tts --list-voices` name).
