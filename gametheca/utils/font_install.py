"""Install the built-in theme fonts.

The faces ship *with* GameTheca, in ``gametheca/setup/fonts``. Installing them
is a file copy onto the library volume, and the network is only a fallback for
a face the bundle happens not to carry.

It did not used to be. The faces were fetched from ``google/fonts`` at first
boot and nothing else, so an install behind a proxy, on an air-gapped box, or
simply one where the fetch failed quietly ended up with a picker offering five
fonts and shipping none of them — every entry reading "not installed", with the
remedy being a script nobody knew to run. Downloading an asset we are allowed to
redistribute, in order to have it locally, was the wrong shape: it made a
cosmetic feature depend on the internet and on an admin.

The runtime location is a Docker volume in production, so a copy on every boot
is what keeps a fresh volume populated — ``gametheca/static/library/fonts`` is
deliberately gitignored, like the rest of that tree.

All faces are SIL Open Font License 1.1 from the official ``google/fonts``
repository. ``OFL.txt`` travels with them and is copied alongside, because
redistributing them without the licence text is not permitted.
