"""Batched hydration for Discover shelves.

Selection and serialization used to be one loop. For every game on the page that
loop ran a cover-image ``SELECT``, lazy-loaded three relationships, stat'd the
game folder twice, and re-asked whether the member had a companion client
connected — the last of which is the same answer for every tile on the page.

That was affordable at 8 tiles across a handful of shelves. At the depth the
Discover rework targets — 40 tiles across up to 20 rows — the same loop is on the
order of 800 cover queries, 800 companion-presence queries and up to 1,600
filesystem stats per page load, on a box whose library commonly lives on a NAS
mount.

So the halves are split. Callers select :class:`~gametheca.models.Game` rows
however they like, then hand the whole feed here once: each per-game query
collapses into one query for the entire feed, and the filesystem checks are
memoised per folder, since one folder can back several rows.

This module deliberately knows nothing about card *shape* — it is the batch, and
``routes_discover.serialize_discover_game`` remains the single place that decides
what a Discover tile looks like.
