"""The Discover row registry.

Every shelf on Discover used to be a branch in one ``if/elif`` chain inside
``build_discover_sections``, which meant the feed had no stage that could see all
its rows at once — so capping the feed, deduping titles across rows, or letting a
member pin one were not merely unimplemented, they were inexpressible.

A row is now a :class:`RowSpec` plus a selector: a callable that takes a member
and a limit and returns ``Game`` rows. Selectors do not serialize, do not know
about other rows, and do not decide whether they will be displayed. That last
part is what later phases need — the feed can drop, reorder, or thin a row
without the row's own code participating.

The fields on ``RowSpec`` beyond ``identifier`` are carried now and consumed
later: ``family`` and ``priority`` feed the slot budget, ``dedupe_mode`` and
``min_fill`` feed cross-row dedupe. They are declared here so a row added in the
meantime already answers the questions those stages will ask.
