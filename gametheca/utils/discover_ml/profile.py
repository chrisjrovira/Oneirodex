"""The taste profile — what a member reaches for, as facet weights.

Signals are weighted by how much intent each one carries. Favouriting is a
deliberate act and counts most; owning a title on a store is a weak signal,
because a bundle buys you fifty games you never asked for. Playtime is scaled
logarithmically so a single 400-hour obsession does not drown out the twenty
titles that better describe a taste.

Everything is decayed by how long ago it happened, so a profile follows a member
rather than fossilising around whatever they were into two years ago.
