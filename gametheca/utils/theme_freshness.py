"""Is the served theme actually the theme we shipped?

Theme CSS/JS is served from ``static/library/themes/<theme>/`` and only gets
there when an admin runs **Reset Themes**, which copies it out of
``setup/default_theme/``. That is a deliberate design — an operator can edit a
theme in place and keep their edits across upgrades — but it has a sharp edge:
after any release that changes theme assets, the running product keeps serving
the previous copy, silently, until somebody presses the button.

Nothing reported that. A stylesheet fix could be written, reviewed, tested,
merged and deployed while the browser went on loading the old file, and the only
symptom was "the fix didn't work" — which sends everyone looking at the CSS
instead of at the copy step. That is exactly how a day gets lost.

Read-only and cheap: it hashes the source and deployed copies of the theme's
own assets and reports which are missing or behind. It never copies anything —
the fix is the existing Reset Themes action, which is an operator's decision.
