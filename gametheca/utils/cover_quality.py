"""Reject downloaded covers that would render as a blank tile.

A cover that HTTP-200s and writes to disk can still be empty to a person:
IGDB (and other CDNs) sometimes serve a 1×1, a tiny stub, or a near-solid
wash. Browse then prefers that local file over the branded placeholder, so
the library shows a hole where the title should be.

Inspect after a successful download. Near-uniform luma or a canvas smaller
than a tile is degenerate; replace the bytes with ``render_cover_art`` —
the same titled fallback ``cover_url`` already draws when nothing local
exists. Screenshots and other kinds are left alone: a dark loading screen
is real content.
