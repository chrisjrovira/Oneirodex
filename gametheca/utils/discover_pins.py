"""Which rows sit at the top of a member's feed, and who decided.

Two independent sources fill the reserved block the feed budget keeps free:
an admin forcing a shelf for everyone, and a member pinning rows for
themselves. Both are capped, so neither can starve the other — an admin keeps a
dependable announcement position, and a member's pins can never be pushed below
the fold on their own home page.

Reading is deliberately forgiving. A pinned row is allowed to stop existing: a
genre row can go away when a member's taste moves, and an admin can hide a shelf
that somebody had pinned. Neither is an error, so an identifier that no longer
resolves is dropped on read rather than raised.
