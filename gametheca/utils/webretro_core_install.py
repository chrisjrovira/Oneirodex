"""Provision the WebRetro libretro cores at first boot.

The cores used to be committed — 71MB of WASM across 24 cores — despite
``cores/README.md`` describing the directory as "operator-owned" and
``tests/test_webretro_cores.py`` opening with "no multi-MB WASM in repo". Both
had it right and the tree did not.

They are removed for licence reasons, not size. The set carries GPL-2.0,
GPL-3.0 and MPL-2.0 terms, and ``snes9x`` and ``genesis_plus_gx`` add custom
clauses restricting commercial distribution. Shipping GPL binaries obliges the
distributor to ship the licence text and a Corresponding Source offer with them,
and none of that was present. Fetching them onto the operator's own box at boot
makes the operator the party doing the provisioning, which is the shape
``scripts/fetch-webretro-cores.sh`` already assumed.

This is the same contract ``font_install`` uses for the OFL faces, with one
deliberate difference: fonts ship bundled and only fall back to the network,
because we may redistribute them. These we may not, so the network is the only
path — and ``FETCH_WEBRETRO_CORES_ON_BOOT=false`` plus ``--from-dir`` is the
air-gapped answer.

Honesty note: browser play reports what it can run from
``platform.WEBRETR_INSTALLED_CORES``. That set stays accurate for a normal
install because the fetch runs by default, so :func:`missing_cores` is what the
boot hook warns on when it does not.
