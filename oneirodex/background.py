"""Background-worker lifecycle, lifted out of ``create_app()``.

``create_app()`` used to start six or seven daemon schedulers inline. That
coupled app construction to a running process — every script that called
``create_app()`` to get a configured app also spawned threads, and there was
no shutdown path. The servers run via uvicorn → ``asgi.py``, whose ASGI
lifespan handler is the right owner: it starts the workers once on startup and
stops them on shutdown.

The scheduler-start block below is moved **verbatim** from ``create_app()`` —
same ``try/except`` per scheduler, same ``logger.warning`` on failure, same
``app.app_context()`` push, same ``pytest`` skip. The only additions are the
``ONEIRODEX_ENABLE_BACKGROUND_WORKERS`` env gate and collecting whatever the
``start_*`` functions return so :func:`stop_background_workers` can ask them to
stop.
