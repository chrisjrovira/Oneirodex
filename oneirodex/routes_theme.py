"""Theme-asset template helpers.

Extracted verbatim from ``oneirodex/routes.py`` (wave A2.1e). These are all
**app-level** Jinja helpers -- one template global (``verify_file``) and three
filters (``dist_asset``, ``avatar_url``, ``theme_asset``) -- not route handlers,
so they were never tied to the ``main`` blueprint's URL map. They now register
through :func:`register_theme_helpers`, called from ``create_app()``.

The version memo (``_THEME_ASSET_VERSIONS`` / ``_theme_asset_version`` /
``clear_theme_asset_versions``) stays with them; Reset Themes still imports
``clear_theme_asset_versions`` (now from this module).

Function bodies moved verbatim; the ``print()`` calls become module-level
``logger`` calls. ``import os`` stays module-level so
``tests/test_routes.py`` can still patch ``routes_theme.os.path.exists``.

    The theme tree got this treatment in W28 and the SPA dists did not, which
    left a gap nobody could see from either side. `asgi.py` serves anything
    outside `static/library/themes/` with `public, max-age=3600`, and these were
    linked at a bare, unchanging path — so after a deploy every browser kept the
    previous `member-app.css` and `member-app.js` for an hour.

    That produced symptoms that look like a CSS bug rather than a cache: a rule
    living in the theme (served `no-cache`) took effect at once while a rule in
    the bundle did not, so one half of a change would work and the other half
    appeared broken. A hovered tile clearing its neighbours *within* a row while
    still being covered by the row below is exactly that split — the card rule
    is in components.css, the row rule is in the bundle.

    Same token as `theme_asset`: mtime and size, memoised per resolved path.

    `@pass_context` for the same reason `theme_asset` needs it — every call site
    passes a literal, and Jinja folds a filter applied to a constant at compile
    time, which would bake one token in for the life of the process and undo the
    point of versioning after a rebuild-without-restart.

    `@pass_context` is load-bearing and has nothing to do with the context.

    Every call site passes a string literal — `{{ 'css/base.css'|theme_asset }}` —
    and Jinja's optimiser constant-folds a filter applied to a constant at
    *compile* time, baking the returned URL into the compiled template. Flask
    caches compiled templates for the life of the process, so the whole install
    kept serving whichever theme happened to be current when each template was
    first rendered. Changing the theme updated `data-theme` on <html> (a real
    variable lookup, so never folded) while every stylesheet link stayed on the
    previous theme — which is exactly "changing the theme does nothing on
    reload", and why it looked like the preference had not saved.

    `nodes._FilterTestCommon.as_const` raises `Impossible` for a filter marked
    `_PassArg.context`, so this marker is what makes the fold illegal and the
    call happen per render. The context itself is unused; `current_user` still
    comes from the request. Do not "tidy" this decorator away — see
