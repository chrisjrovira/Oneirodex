"""Discover zones — the feed as a few named surfaces instead of one long scroll.

A zone is a landing surface: a slug, a title, and the rows that belong to it.
Twelve rows stacked on one page is a scroll, not a destination; the same twelve
split across "For you", "New & updated", "Popular" and "From the stores" are
four places a member can mean to go.

**Zones own no rows of their own.** A zone is a *filter over the feed* — it
names identifiers that `discover_providers.resolve_feed` already produced, and
the whole pipeline behind that (library ACL, section visibility, schedule
windows, member hide, cross-row dedupe, `hide_when_empty`) runs unchanged. That
is deliberate and load-bearing:

- a shelf an admin hides disappears from its zone without the zone knowing;
- a zone whose rows are all empty resolves to nothing and is dropped from the
  zone list, so the honesty rule that removed empty *rows* removes empty
  *zones* for free;
- adding a row to the registry needs no zone edit — `_FALLBACK_BY_FAMILY`
  places it, and `ZONE_FOR_UNPLACED` catches anything with no family rule.

Nothing here writes to the database and nothing here is admin-configurable yet.
Membership is declared in code because the set of *system* rows is declared in
code; when zones need to be arranged per install, this registry is the thing
that grows a `DiscoverySection`-backed override, not a second mechanism.

**Naming.** Until 2026-09-06 this module's name was one letter from
`discovery_zones.py`, which called a single admin-curated shelf a "custom zone"
(UID-059). That module is now `discovery_shelves.py` and its concept is a
*shelf* throughout, admin copy included, so "zone" means one thing again: a page
of shelves. A custom shelf is one of the things a zone can contain — they land
in ``curated``.
