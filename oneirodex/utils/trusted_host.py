"""Which ``Host`` header this install is willing to put inside an email link.

Why this exists
---------------
``send_password_reset_email`` built its link with ``url_for(..., _external=True)``
and :func:`oneirodex.utils.public_origin.public_origin` fell back to
``request.url_root``. Both derive the origin from the request's ``Host`` header,
which the *caller* controls, and neither Flask nor this app sets ``SERVER_NAME``
or validated the host anywhere.

Password reset is unauthenticated, so that was reachable by anyone: POST
``/reset_password_request`` for another member's address with
``Host: attacker.example`` and the victim receives a genuine Oneirodex email
whose reset link — carrying a working token — points at the attacker. Invite
mail had the same shape one step further in (an admin has to trigger it).

Why not a plain allowlist
-------------------------
A strict allowlist that defaults to empty would reject the normal case. A fresh
household install is reached by LAN IP (``http://192.168.50.116:5006``) with no
Site URL configured yet, and refusing that would break the very flow being
protected — the operator would have to fix Site URL *through* a login they can
no longer reset. So the default posture is "private hosts only":

* ``TRUSTED_LINK_HOSTS`` set   → exactly those hosts, nothing else.
* ``TRUSTED_LINK_HOSTS`` unset → loopback, RFC1918 / CGNAT / link-local addresses,
  ``localhost``, dotless LAN names, and ``.local`` / ``.lan`` / ``.home.arpa`` /
  ``.internal`` / ``.localdomain`` suffixes.

Every realistic LAN install keeps working; ``attacker.example`` stops being a
usable origin. An install genuinely published on a public hostname sets
``TRUSTED_LINK_HOSTS`` (or Site URL, which is preferred over the request host
anyway).
