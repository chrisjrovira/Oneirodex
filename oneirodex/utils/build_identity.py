"""What is actually running here, and is it what was shipped?

After a deploy that question had no answer from inside the product. The version
was a literal in ``__init__.py``; the Alembic revision was never read back (only
the table's *existence* was checked); and no git SHA or build timestamp reached
the process at all -- the image tag was the only build identity and it is not
readable from within the container.

So an operator could redeploy, watch the container come up healthy, and still
not know whether the code was new or whether the migration had run. That is the
gap this closes.

Every field degrades to ``None`` and nothing here raises, which is the contract
``system_stats.get_gpu_usage`` (INSP-44) already set for ops collectors: a tile
that reads *n/a* is honest, and one that takes the Ops poll down with it is not.
