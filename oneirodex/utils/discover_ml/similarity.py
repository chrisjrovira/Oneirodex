"""Neighbourhoods — what a title is like, and what gets played alongside it.

Two methods write into the same table.

``content`` compares facet sets. It works on an install with one member and a
library nobody has touched, which is why it is the default and why *Because you
played X* can appear on day one.

``collab`` counts how often two titles are played by the same people. It is a
genuinely better signal — when there are enough people. Below the floor it is
noise wearing a lab coat: with four members, two titles co-occurring once is
indistinguishable from coincidence, and the recommender would state it with the
same confidence as a real result. So the job skips it, the blend falls back to
pure content, and nothing pretends otherwise.
