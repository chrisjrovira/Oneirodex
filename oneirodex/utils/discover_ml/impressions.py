"""Impression damping and daily rotation — how the feed stays fresh.

"Fresh content" reads like a modelling problem and is not one. The reason the
same eight tiles greet somebody every morning is that nothing remembers having
shown them. Two mechanics fix that, and neither involves a recommender:

* **Damping.** A title shown repeatedly and never opened is scored down, so the
  feed stops insisting. Opening it clears the damping — a tile that got clicked
  has earned its place.
* **Rotation.** The ranked tail is shuffled with a seed derived from the member
  and the date, so the feed is stable within a day and different tomorrow.
  Reshuffling on every request instead would read as broken: tiles would move
  under the pointer between one glance and the next.
