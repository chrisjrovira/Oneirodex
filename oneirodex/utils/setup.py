    Reads via global_settings_row() so this module agrees with every other
    reader about *which* row is the singleton. The bare `.first()` it used had
    no ORDER BY, and the table is only a singleton by convention — with more
    than one row present Postgres is free to return a different one per query,
    so this could hand back a row that a caller had just configured a moment
    earlier and see none of its values.

    Creates through global_settings_row_or_create() for the same reason
    get_or_create_settings_record does: the singleton unique index turns a
    concurrent first-boot insert into an IntegrityError, and the helper's
    SAVEPOINT is what makes that recoverable instead of a 500. The commit stays
    here — callers of *this* function expect a persisted row — while the
    helper's flush is what stage_setup_step relies on.

    set_setup_step() commits, which is wrong when the caller is mid-transaction:
    the admin account and its step advance have to succeed or fail together, or
    a failure between them strands the install on step 1 with a user present —
    a state get_setup_redirect_url() turns into an endless /setup redirect.

    Callers own the commit. Note this must not call
    get_or_create_global_settings(): on a fresh install there is no settings row
    (is_setup_required short-circuits before anything would create one), so that
    helper would commit the caller's pending admin user alongside a settings row
    still holding the column default of step 1 — reopening the very window this
    function exists to close.

    global_settings_row_or_create() is the canonical create-without-commit read:
    it flushes, so the row is usable immediately but still rolls back with the
    caller's transaction.
