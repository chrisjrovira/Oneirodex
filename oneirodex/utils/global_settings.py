"""One place to read the GlobalSettings singleton.

`global_settings` is a one-row table, but nothing at the database level enforces
that and roughly fifteen code paths will create a row when they find none — so a
race at startup, or a restore that merged two dumps, can leave two.

Most readers used to do:

    db.session.execute(select(GlobalSettings)).scalar_one_or_none()

which raises ``MultipleResultsFound`` the moment a second row exists. Six of
those were in the login blueprint, so a duplicate row would have locked every
user out of the site. Others sat in the scanner and in game_core, where the
failure would surface as an unrelated-looking scan error.

Reading the lowest id is what the settings writers already assume elsewhere
(``quality_profiles._settings_row``), and a second row should degrade to "use
the first", never to a 500.

    The insert runs inside a SAVEPOINT because the table now carries a
    single-row unique index (see cleanup_duplicate_global_settings in
    updateschema.py). That turns the old failure mode inside out: two workers
    racing on first boot used to *both* succeed and leave a duplicate, where a
    later write could land on the row nobody reads and silently not take
    effect. Now the loser gets an IntegrityError, which is recoverable — the
