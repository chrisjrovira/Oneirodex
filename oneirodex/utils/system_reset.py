"""Scoped factory reset for the admin surface.

What this does and, more importantly, does not do
-------------------------------------------------
This empties Oneirodex's *database* — the catalog it built, the accounts it
holds, the settings it was given. It never touches a single file on disk.

That distinction is the whole point. A game library is years of collecting; the
rows describing it are a cache that a scan can rebuild in an afternoon. So the
reset deliberately has no filesystem access at all: no ``os.remove``, no
``shutil.rmtree``, nothing that takes a path. Scanned media, artwork the
operator supplied, firmware on the BIOS volume and the theme tree all survive by
construction rather than by remembering to exclude them. If a future change
needs to delete a file, it does not belong in this module.

Scopes
------
Four, chosen so an operator can clear the thing that is actually wrong instead
of starting over:

``catalog``
    Games, matches, unmatched folders, scan jobs, artwork records, reference
    sets. The output of scanning. Library *definitions* survive, so the next
    scan starts immediately.
``libraries``
    The library rows themselves, plus the filters and access grants that hang
    off them. Implies ``catalog`` — a library row cannot go while its games
    remain pointing at it.
``users``
    Members and everything personal: favorites, collections, playtime, chat,
    invites, notifications, saves. The acting admin is recreated afterwards, so
    the operator is never locked out of the install they just reset.
``settings``
    Server settings, integration credentials, themes, discovery sections,
    announcements. Returns the install to first-boot configuration.

Ordering and integrity
----------------------
Tables are emptied with a single ``TRUNCATE ... RESTART IDENTITY CASCADE``.
One statement, so it is one transaction: either the whole reset lands or none of
it does, and there is no half-cleared database to explain. ``CASCADE`` lets
Postgres resolve foreign keys rather than this module hard-coding a dependency
order that would rot the first time a model gains a relationship.

Because ``CASCADE`` can reach past the tables named, :func:`plan_reset` reports
the full closure it will empty, and the route shows that list before the
operator confirms. A reset that quietly cleared more than it listed would be
exactly the kind of surprise this module exists to avoid.
