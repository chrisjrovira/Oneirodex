"""Scan locations ("library roots") an operator can point Oneirodex at.

Oneirodex scans whatever it can open as a local path, and that is not the same
thing as "a path on the box the service runs on": an SMB/NFS share, an Unraid
user share, a second internal disk, or an extra Docker bind mount all become
scannable the moment the host — or the container — mounts them. What was
missing was a way to *declare* those mounts, because the folder browser and the
path allowlist both keyed off a single ``BASE_FOLDER_*``.

``ONEIRODEX_LIBRARY_ROOTS`` / ``ONEIRODEX_LIBRARY_ROOTS`` is that declaration. Entries
are separated by ``|`` and each one is an optional ``Label=`` followed by the
path Oneirodex sees:

    ONEIRODEX_LIBRARY_ROOTS=NAS ROMs=/mnt/nas/roms|Archive=/mnt/archive/games

The label is cosmetic (it names the root in the admin folder browser); the path
is what matters. Mounting the share is still the operator's job — see
docs/runbooks/remote-scan-locations.md.
