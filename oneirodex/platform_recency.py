"""How recent each platform's hardware is, for ranking copies of one title.

The library shows one tile per row, so a household that keeps a game on three
systems sees three unrelated tiles. Collapsing them to one tile means choosing
*which* copy represents the title, and the answer asked for is "the latest
system it was released on" — hardware recency, not when the file was scanned.

`LibraryPlatform` cannot answer that. It is an arbitrary declaration order that
has been appended to over time: `SWITCH` and `ARCADE` sit after `O2EM`, and
`AMIGA` after `ARCADE`. Nothing in it encodes generation, so this table does.

The value is the platform's **launch year**, which is the ordering people mean
by "newer console". It is a ranking key, not a fact anyone reads, so precision
past the year is pointless — but the years are real, so the ordering can be
checked against the world rather than argued about.

Judgement calls worth naming, because they are the ones a reviewer will query:

* **PC (`PCWIN`, `MAC`) sorts above every console.** A PC release is the one
  that is still current, still patched, and almost always the copy someone
  means to launch. Ranking it by the year Windows shipped would bury it under a
  Dreamcast. `PCDOS` keeps its real era, because a DOS build genuinely is the
  old copy.
* **`ARCADE` and `DAPHNE` sort low.** An arcade board is the *original* release
  of anything that also exists on a console, which is what the rank is asked to
  express. `PINBALL` sits with them.
* **`OTHER` sorts lowest of all.** An unclassified library must never win the
  representative slot over a system that was actually identified.

Add a platform here whenever one is added to `LibraryPlatform`;
`tests/test_platform_recency.py` fails until you do, so the table cannot fall
silently out of step and start ranking new systems as if they were the oldest.
