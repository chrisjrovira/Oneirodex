# Emulator BIOS / firmware (operator-supplied)

**Audience:** Operator · **Stance:** LOCKED

## What GameTheca does and does not do

GameTheca **never downloads, bundles, or ships console BIOS**. Those files are
proprietary console firmware — Sony, Sega, Nintendo, Panasonic, SNK and friends
still own them. The application only ever:

1. **describes** what each libretro core asks for (`BIOS_REQUIREMENTS`), and
2. **reports** which of those files are present on your firmware volume.

Filling the gaps is the operator's job, from a source you are entitled to use —
a dump of hardware you own, or a firmware set you already hold. The public image
stays upload-only, and `.gitignore` blocks `bios/`, `**/bios/*.bin`,
`**/bios/*.rom` and `gametheca/static/library/bios/` so firmware cannot reach the
public repository even by accident.

## Where files go

| Deployment | Location |
|---|---|
| Docker / Unraid | the volume mounted at `EMULATOR_BIOS_PATH` |
| Bare metal (default) | `gametheca/static/library/bios/` |

Drop files in flat — no per-system subfolders. Names are matched
case-insensitively, so `SCPH5501.BIN` and `scph5501.bin` both count.

## Checking coverage

**Admin → Emulation → Firmware** lists every system that needs firmware and what
is missing, e.g. *"PC Engine CD — missing `syscard3.pce`"*. The same data is on
`GET /api/emulator-bios`:

- `platforms[]` — per-system view: `required`, `present`, `missing`, `ready`,
  `blocking`
- `cores[]` — the older per-core view, kept for existing callers
- `files[]` — what is actually on the volume

`blocking: true` means that system genuinely cannot boot without the file.
Optional accuracy files (for example `gba_bios.bin`, which mGBA replaces with its
HLE fallback) are reported as missing but never marked blocking, so the panel
does not cry wolf.

## Systems that need firmware

Cores read these names; region variants are interchangeable — **any one** present
is usually enough.

| PlayStation Vita | `PSP2UPDAT.PUP` |

### Optional — improves accuracy, not required to boot

These have a slot in the panel so you can see it exists, but the system plays
without them, so a missing file here is not reported as blocking.

| System | Files | Needed for |
|---|---|---|
| Famicom Disk System | `disksys.rom` | FDS disk images only; carts are fine |
| GameCube / Wii | `IPL.bin` | the GameCube boot animation |
| SNES | `dsp1.bin` · `dsp1b.bin` · `dsp2.bin` · `dsp3.bin` · `dsp4.bin` · `cx4.bin` · `st010.bin` · `st011.bin` | a handful of co-processor carts |
| Nintendo 64 | `64DD_IPL.n64` | 64DD disk images |
| Master System / SG-1000 | `bios_U.sms` · `bios.col` | boot-ROM accuracy |
| Atari Jaguar | `jagboot.rom` | the Jaguar boot logo |
| Commodore 64 | `kernal` · `basic` · `chargen` | exact-revision accuracy; the core embeds its own |

Neo Geo AES cart sets expect `neogeo.zip` alongside the ROMs rather than on the
firmware volume — it is a MAME/FBNeo parent set, not a BIOS file. The same is
true of the other MAME-driven systems (Astrocade, Arcadia, Advision, Studio II):
their system files are per-romset archives, so they are deliberately absent from
the firmware panel rather than reported as permanently missing.

### Why some systems are not in the panel at all

One libretro core often serves several consoles, and its firmware usually
belongs to only one of them. `genesis_plus_gx` runs Mega Drive, Master System,
Game Gear, SG-1000, 32X **and** Sega CD — but only the Sega CD needs a BIOS.

Requirements are therefore scoped per *platform*, not per core
(`PLATFORM_BIOS_OVERRIDES` in `gametheca/utils/emulator_bios.py`). A system that
needs no firmware drops out of the panel rather than appearing with a
requirement that makes no sense for it:

| Core | Firmware belongs to | Absent from the panel |
|---|---|---|
| `genesis_plus_gx` | Sega CD | Mega Drive · Master System · Game Gear · SG-1000 · 32X |
| `mgba` | Game Boy Advance | Game Boy · Game Boy Color |
| `mednafen_pce*` | PC Engine CD | PC Engine (HuCard) · SuperGrafx |
| `dolphin` | GameCube (`IPL.bin`) | Wii |

Before this scoping the panel unioned every core's requirements onto every
platform that core served, so five cartridge Sega systems claimed to need the
Sega CD BIOS — and, once those files were present, all five reported "ready" on
the strength of firmware irrelevant to a cartridge. The verdict was accidentally
right and the reason shown was wrong.

The **per-core** view is unaffected and still lists `genesis_plus_gx` as wanting
the Sega CD files, which is true of the core.

## Upload guardrails

Uploads are treated as untrusted: extension allowlist, and a size cap
(`EMULATOR_BIOS_MAX_BYTES`, default 64 MB) so a stray disk image cannot fill the
volume.

Two firmware names cannot be expressed as an extension — the Commodore 64 ROMs
(`kernal`, `basic`, `chargen`) have no suffix at all, and the 3DS key file is a
plain `.txt`. Those four are allowed by **exact filename** instead, so the volume
does not have to accept every extensionless or text upload to admit them.
