# RetroAchievements (R1/R2)

Matches cartridge ROMs to community achievement sets by hash, so game details can
say a set exists and a member can see their own progress. **Read-only**: nothing
played in the browser unlocks anything — there is no rcheevos runtime in the WASM
shell — and the member copy says so.

## Turn it on

1. Sign in at retroachievements.org and open **Settings → Keys** for the *web API
   key* (not the Connect key).
2. Put both values in the server environment (`.env`, then restart):

   ```
   RETROACHIEVEMENTS_USERNAME=the-account-that-owns-the-key
   RETROACHIEVEMENTS_API_KEY=...
   ```

   Both are required. With one missing, Admin → Emulators → RetroAchievements says
   which half it has, the plugin reports `available`, and no title claims a set.
3. **Admin → Emulators → RetroAchievements → Match** per system. Each run refreshes
   that console's hash index (cached 24h) and hashes every game on the platform that
   has a disk path, storing the match on the game.

Re-run Match after a scan adds titles. Hashes are cached per game, so a second run
only hashes what is new.

## What gets matched

| | |
|---|---|
| Systems | NES · SNES · N64 · GB/GBC/GBA · Mega Drive · Master System · Game Gear · 32X · SG-1000 · PC Engine · Lynx · NGP/NGPC · WonderSwan · Virtual Boy · ColecoVision · Intellivision · Vectrex · Odyssey² · Channel F · Jaguar · Atari 2600/5200/7800 |
| Not matched | Every disc system (PS1, Saturn, Sega CD, 3DO, Neo Geo CD, NDS…). RetroAchievements hashes those from track data in ways this build does not reproduce, and a wrong match is worse than none. |
| Archives | A `.zip` / `.7z` / `.rar` holding one ROM dump is hashed through to the dump. |

The hash is **not** `file_md5`. RetroAchievements strips an iNES/FDS header and sizes
the body from it, strips a 512-byte SNES copier header, strips Lynx/PCE/7800 headers,
and normalises N64 images to big-endian z64 order before hashing. That is why this
does not ride on the DAT matcher's `md5` column.

## Honesty rules

- `supports_achievements` is true only for a matched set that **carries** achievements.
  A matched set with zero is stored (`ra_game_id`) but promises nothing: no badge, no
  section, no CTA.
- Unconfigured is *no data*, never a silent empty list: the panel says exactly which
  environment variable is missing, and the plugin registry reports `available`.
- The member's RetroAchievements username is a public handle stored on
  `user_preferences.ra_username`. Oneirodex never asks for their RA password or key.

## API

| Route | Who | What |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /api/retroachievements/status` | admin | Configured? Per-console index size/age and matched counts. |
| `POST /api/retroachievements/match` | admin | `{platform, rehash?}` — refresh index if stale, hash and match. |
| `GET /api/games/<uuid>/achievements` | member | The matched set + this member's progress (cached 10 min) + `unlocks_here: false`. |
| `GET`/`PUT /api/me/retroachievements` | member | Their RA username. |

Provider endpoints used: `API_GetGameList.php` (`h=1&f=1`) and
`API_GetGameInfoAndUserProgress.php`. Both are GETs; nothing is ever written to
RetroAchievements.
