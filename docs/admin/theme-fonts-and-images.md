# Theme fonts & bulk artwork upload

Two admin surfaces that let you bring your own assets: **fonts** for theming and
**batch image upload** for artwork you have already prepared.

## Fonts

### What ships, and what does not

Oneirodex does **not** bundle console manufacturers' typefaces. The real
Nintendo, Sega and Sony faces are trademarked and not licensed for
redistribution, so shipping them would put an infringing asset in every install.

What the font picker offers instead is a registry of **OFL / public-domain**
faces chosen to *evoke* each era:

| Id | Face | Era | Licence |
|---|---|---|---|
| `system-ui` | System UI (default) | modern | uses the reader's own system fonts |
| `press-start` | Press Start 2P | 8-bit | SIL OFL 1.1 |
| `silkscreen` | Silkscreen | compact pixel | SIL OFL 1.1 |
| `vt323` | VT323 | CRT terminal | SIL OFL 1.1 |
| `share-tech-mono` | Share Tech Mono | arcade cabinet | SIL OFL 1.1 |
| `orbitron` | Orbitron | 32-bit / disc era | SIL OFL 1.1 |

> ✅ **All five ship with Oneirodex — you do not install them.** The `.ttf`
> files are vendored in `gametheca/setup/fonts/` (with `OFL.txt`) and copied
> into the runtime fonts folder on **every** startup, so a fresh volume
> repopulates itself. No network, no admin step, works air-gapped.
>
> The API still reports `installed: true|false` per entry and only emits
> `@font-face` for files that exist — so if the picker ever says *not
> installed*, that is a real filesystem problem (read-only or full volume),
> not the normal state. Check the boot log for `Theme font install skipped`.

### How the built-in faces get installed

| Step | What happens |
|---|---|
| Boot, phase 4 | `seed_builtin_fonts()` copies any missing bundled face into the fonts folder — same model as the icon packs beside it |
| Face not in the bundle | Falls back to a background download from google/fonts; `FETCH_FONTS_ON_BOOT=false` disables that half only |
| Copy fails | Logged, boot continues — a missing face degrades to the next family in its CSS stack |

Runtime location is `gametheca/static/library/fonts/` (override with
`FONT_PATH`). Under Compose that lives inside the volume mounted at
`LIBRARY_HOST_PATH`. That path is gitignored, which is exactly why the bundled
copy exists: the tracked source of truth is `gametheca/setup/fonts/`.

Filenames are load-bearing — `missing_builtin_fonts()` matches the `file` field
in `BUILT_IN_FONTS`:

```
PressStart2P-Regular.ttf
Silkscreen-Regular.ttf
VT323-Regular.ttf
ShareTechMono-Regular.ttf
Orbitron-Variable.ttf
```

> **Adding a face to the registry?** Put the file in `gametheca/setup/fonts/`
> in the same commit. `tests/test_font_bundle.py` fails on a registered face
> with no bundled file, because that combination is what put "not installed" in
> front of members in the first place.

Restart is not required to *pick* a font — the catalogue is read from disk per
request. A restart is what installs a face the bundle gained in an upgrade.

### Historical note

Before this, the faces were fetched from google/fonts on a background thread at
the end of first-run setup and nowhere else. An install behind a proxy, on an
air-gapped box, one already past setup, or one where the fetch simply failed
quietly ended up offering five fonts in the picker and shipping none of them —
with the remedy being `scripts/fetch-fonts.py`, a script nobody knew to run.
Downloading a redistributable asset in order to have it locally was the wrong
shape; the files ship now.

### Uploading a font from the admin UI

`POST /admin/api/theme/fonts` (admin only, multipart field `file`).

Uploads are treated as untrusted, because the result is a file served back to
every member's browser:

- **Extension allowlist** — `.ttf`, `.otf`, `.woff`, `.woff2`
- **Size cap** — `FONT_MAX_BYTES`, default 8MB
- **Magic-byte check** — the leading bytes must match a real font container
  (`\x00\x01\x00\x00`, `true`, `ttcf`, `OTTO`, `wOFF`, `wOF2`). An extension on
  its own is not evidence.

Anything you upload appears in the picker alongside the built-ins, labelled
`(operator)`. If you hold a licence for a face closer to what you want, this is
the supported way to use it — no code change needed.

`DELETE /admin/api/theme/fonts/<filename>` removes an uploaded font. Built-in
filenames are **refused**, so a delete cannot leave the registry pointing at a
file you can no longer restore.

### Per-system faces

Emulator and library surfaces can pick an era-appropriate face automatically.
The mapping is by **era, not brand** — this is period flavour, not an imitation
of a logo:

| Era | Face | Example systems |
|---|---|---|
| 8-bit | Press Start 2P | NES, SNES, Master System, PC Engine |
| Compact pixel | Silkscreen | Game Boy / Color / Advance, Game Gear |
| Arcade | Share Tech Mono | Arcade, Neo Geo, Mega Drive, 32X |
| 32-bit / disc | Orbitron | PS1, PS2, Saturn, Dreamcast, N64, GameCube, 3DO |
| CRT terminal | VT323 | MS-DOS, Amiga, C64 |

Systems with no opinion fall back to `system-ui`.

### Config

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `FONT_PATH` | Where fonts live. Empty = `static/library/fonts` (what Compose wants — already a persisted volume) |
| `FONT_MAX_BYTES` | Upload cap in bytes; default `8388608` (8MB) |

### API

| Method | Route | Who |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/api/theme/fonts` | any signed-in member — catalogue + `installed` flags |
| `GET` | `/api/theme/fonts.css` | **anyone, signed in or not** — the stylesheet itself |
| `POST` | `/admin/api/theme/fonts` | admin — upload |
| `DELETE` | `/admin/api/theme/fonts/<filename>` | admin — remove an uploaded face |

`fonts.css` is the route that makes the feature visible: it emits the
`@font-face` blocks for every installed face and sets `--gt-font-family` from
the caller's preference (`?font=<id>` overrides it; unknown ids fall back to
`system-ui`). Installing the files and listing them in the picker does nothing
on its own — without this stylesheet no page ever declares the families.

Unauthenticated on purpose: public CSS for public font files, so the login page
renders in the household face too. Cached for 60s, so a font upload or a
preference change shows up promptly rather than instantly.

## Batch artwork upload

`POST /admin/api/images/batch_upload` (admin only, multipart field `files`,
repeatable) uploads a folder of prepared artwork in one pass.

### Matching files to games

Each file is matched by **filename**:

| Filename pattern | Result |
|---|---|
| `<game_uuid>.png` | applied with the form-wide kind (default `cover`) |
| `<game_uuid>_<kind>.png` | applied with that kind |

You can also set `game_uuid` on the form to send every file to one game — useful
for uploading several screenshots at once.

Valid kinds: `cover`, `screenshot`, `box`, `cart`, `disc`, `logo`, `hero`,
`fanart`. Everything except `screenshot` is **singular** — uploading a new one
replaces the existing row rather than stacking duplicates.

### Limits and failure behaviour

- **Types** — `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.webp`, `.gif`
- **Size** — 10MB per file
- **Per-file outcomes** — one bad file does not sink the batch. The response
  reports `stored`, `failed`, and a per-file `errors` array with the reason
  (`Unsupported image type`, `Empty file`, `Larger than the 10MB limit`,
  `No game matched this filename`).

Nothing is committed unless at least one file stored successfully.

### Typical use

1. Export art named after each game's UUID (copy UUIDs from the library table).
2. Suffix by kind where you want something other than the default: `…_hero.png`,
   `…_logo.png`.
3. Upload the folder; read the per-file report for anything that missed.

## Generated cover art (optional)

If you would rather generate art than source it, `ENABLE_AI_ARTWORK` points
Oneirodex at **your own** A1111-compatible endpoint — see
[settings-modules.md](settings-modules.md#generated-cover-art). It is off by
default and nothing leaves your network.
