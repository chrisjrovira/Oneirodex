# Themes & reset

Themes live on the **library volume** (`/app/oneirodex/static/library/themes/...`), not only in the image. Source of truth for defaults: `oneirodex/setup/default_theme/`. Preset generation uses **`GENERATOR_VERSION` 28** in `oneirodex/utils/preset_themes.py` (edge-tile hover clip-margin; prior 27 = Catalog Grid shelves skip Tile pullback). **Reset Default Themes** after this bump — volume copies stay on the previous generator until you do.

## Default look

- Accent **`#2fd67b`** (green glass Style B+C).
- Glass tokens: `--od-glass-bg`, `--od-glass-border`, `--od-glass-blur`.
- Admin → Themes is a dense `od-adminpage` surface (upload · reset · **installed themes as a list** · loading icons) — no separate “Back to Dashboard” stack; use the React top bar. Choosing a theme happens in Preferences, not here — see [Apply a theme](#apply-a-theme).
- Member SPA also needs built **`member-app.css`** in dist — theme reset does not replace a missing SPA bundle.

## When to Reset Default Themes

After any deploy that changes tokens, admin CSS, or preset fingerprints:

1. Free Unraid host disk if ~99% full — [unraid-deploy.md § Deploy gates](../runbooks/unraid-deploy.md#deploy-gates-operator-checklist)
2. `docker compose build --no-cache && docker compose up -d` (image must rebuild **`frontend/member-app` dist**)
3. **Reset Default Themes** — Admin → Themes, or (admin) Preferences → Look & density
4. Reload normally; confirm accent green, admin pages styled, and View Source includes **`member-app.css` / `member-app.js`**

> **A reset is visible immediately as of 2026-08-16 — a hard refresh is no longer part of the
> procedure.** It used to be, and the reason was a caching bug rather than anything about themes:
> every static file was served `public, max-age=3600` with **no validator**, while Reset Themes
> rewrites `themes/<theme>/…` in place behind an identical URL. Nothing about the request changed, so
> the browser answered from cache for up to an hour and a completed reset looked like it had failed.
> `theme_asset` now versions each URL by the file's mtime and size, and `/static/library/themes/` is
> served `no-cache` so even an unversioned reference revalidates. **If you are following older notes
> that say "hard-refresh or it won't take", that step is obsolete** — if a reset still looks
> unapplied, the cause is now genuinely elsewhere (most often a missing SPA rebuild, below).

Or delete `themes/default` (and stale presets) under the library volume and restart so boot sync can reinstall.

**Post-deploy pair (always both):** Reset Themes (volume CSS/JS) **and** a rebuild that includes member-app dist (SPA bundle). Skipping either leaves a half-applied Unraid pull.

**Two different things after an Unraid `git pull` + rebuild:**

| Asset | Where it lives | How it updates |
|---|---|---|
| Admin / library color theme CSS (`gt-*` tokens, swatch grid) | `oneirodex/setup/default_theme/` → copied onto the **library volume** on boot | Needs **Reset Default Themes** (or delete `themes/default` + restart) — a plain rebuild alone does not overwrite already-installed volume copies |
| Scan management CSS/JS (`admin_manage_scanjobs.css` / `.js` + **W22-1** `admin_manage_libs.css` / `.js` — Libraries tab merge, multi-select sticky **Scan**/**Edit** → batch APIs, force-delete, unmatched Open path, table scale, **UID-005** per-entry top actions bar + Resolve equal-pill bar + sortable columns, **UID-016** Dupe glance + Unmatched side-by-side Compare (This folder \| Library game · path/size/date) + **2026-08-26 Pop out** dialog, **Library tools tab**, **Scan Filters** how-it-works / quick-add / `dir:` kind UI, Wave 17 **Search name**/batch/Dupe-of, **Wave 18** scan job elapsed/ETA/stalled + status/library/path filters, **W20-2** Name transform trail `<details>`, **Layout** chips / `od-toast-host`, **UI-W22-M7** Soft title / Utility kind labels on Unmatched / Dupe glance / mark-kind) | Same theme tree → **library volume** copies | Needs rebuild **and** **Reset Default Themes** (or hard-refresh alone is not enough if volume copies are stale) — without Reset, unmatched tab can look cramped / miss Open path chrome / miss Pop out / miss Library tools tab JS / miss top actions bar · Resolve pill bar · column sort / miss UID-016 side-by-side Compare / miss Scan Filters explain UI / miss Wave 18 timing+filter chrome / miss W20-2 transform trail expander / miss W22 Libraries tab + sticky Scan/Edit batch wire + force-delete / miss Soft title·Utility kind copy (still show “experience”/opaque labels) |
| Auth / account / identify / Edit Images aurora (`od-setup` · `od-account` · prefs modal · identify `od-adminpage` · **Wave 19** `game_edit_images` aurora + chip underline/scale · **2026-08-25** uploaded-image DOM builders, no `innerHTML` URL interpolation) | Theme tree CSS/templates/JS → **library volume** copies | Needs rebuild **and** **Reset Default Themes** after aurora / Edit Images deploy — without Reset, login/account/identify/Edit Images can still show pre-aurora chrome **and the XSS-safe image insert will not be live** |
| P1 densified-admin Jinja (`od-adminpage` logs/status/whitelist/library-create/SMTP/integrations/users/… · `admin-pages.css` `od-meter` · `admin-components.css` 1600px settings) | Theme tree CSS/templates → **library volume** copies | After P1 densify deploy: **Reset Default Themes** so `library/themes` picks up widened settings shells and aurora meters — otherwise operators still see the 1100px / hybrid glass chrome |
| Member SPA bundle (`member-app.css` / `.js` — FilterBar `od-btn*` · **UID-009** `ScrollJump` · locale dates, CSS toasts, Acquire indexer labels · **UID-001** BadgeStack / GameCard layout JS) | Built into the **image/dist**, not the theme volume | Needs image rebuild that includes a fresh `frontend/member-app` dist — **Reset Themes alone does not refresh SPA JS/CSS** |
| Admin SPA bundle (`admin-app.css` / `.js` — Settings hub grouped rows · On/Off pills · Server Settings nested-card flatten) | Built into the **image/dist**, not the theme volume | Needs image rebuild that includes a fresh `frontend/admin-app` dist — **Reset Themes alone does not restyle `/admin/settings`** |
| Member chrome theme mirror (**UID-009** `od-chrome.css` — ScrollJump glass top/bottom controls) | Theme tree CSS → **library volume** copies | Needs rebuild **and** **Reset Default Themes** after ScrollJump / chrome deploy — without Reset, jump controls can miss aurora glass tokens from stale volume CSS |
| Library tile badge chrome (**UID-001** — rounded-square `.od-badge` / stacks / platform chip / hamburger · favorite · status in `css/components.css` + Signals filter chips in `games/library_filters.css`) | Theme tree → **library volume** copies | Needs rebuild **and** **Reset Default Themes** — without Reset, tiles can keep old pill/circle badge chrome or empty reserved corner slots from stale volume CSS |
| Admin SPA SoT re-exports (`stageECandidates.js` / `unmatchedTriage.js` / `scanJobsDom.js` used by Dupe glance / unmatched triage / Libraries & scans poll) | Theme tree JS is SoT; `Dockerfile` `frontend-build` **COPY**s those files into `/build/oneirodex/...` before admin-app `npm run build` | Image rebuild picks up admin bundle + theme JS together — still **Reset Themes** for Jinja scanjobs volume copies of the same files |
| Browser Play room skins (`play-skins.css` / `play-skins.js` / `webretro.html`, atmosphere stack · bezel mat · aspect-lock vars) | `oneirodex/static/vendor/webretro/` — served **directly from the image**, not copied to the library volume | Picks up on a normal `docker compose build --no-cache && docker compose up -d` — **no** Reset Default Themes needed, but the browser tab needs a hard-refresh (Ctrl+F5) to drop cached CSS/JS |
| Modal stacking helper (`js/od_modal_stack.js`) + `modal-components.css` | Copied onto the **library volume** with the theme tree | Needs rebuild **and** Reset Default Themes (or rely on **inline** stacking CSS in `base_admin.html` / Libraries / Integrations, which works after rebuild alone) |
| Local vendor CDN scrub (`static/vendor/bootstrap/5.3.2/` + jquery/datatables/notify/cropper/sortable/chart under `/static/vendor/...`) on `base_admin` · member `base.html` · `base_empty.html` (login extends `base`) | Served from the **image/static**, not the theme volume | Picks up on rebuild/restart — **no** Reset Themes for vendor libs; still Reset Themes for theme-volume CSS/JS (e.g. `admin_manage_libs.js` typed-confirm delete modal) |
| Account / prefs chrome (`od-account.css` · prefs modal · `modal-components`) | Theme tree → **library volume** | After Wave 2c densify: if account/prefs chrome still looks pre-sectioned or modal stacking lags, run **Reset Default Themes** (volume copies stale) — same gate as aurora scrub row above |
| Wave 2d presets + loading motifs (`GENERATOR_VERSION` **10** at the time · paired `default_icon_pack` · `od-loading-motifs.css` / `od_loading_motifs.js`) | Theme tree tokens/CSS/JS → **library volume** | After Wave 2d ship: rebuild **and** **Reset Default Themes** — without Reset, presets stay accent-only (v9) and Auto Scan misses motif CSS |
| Geometry packs (`GENERATOR_VERSION` **16** — UID-006 radius / space / type / shadow per preset) | Theme tree tokens → **library volume** | After 2026-08-26: rebuild **and** **Reset Default Themes** — without Reset, presets keep v10 geometry (hue + pairing only) |
| Decade rooms (`GENERATOR_VERSION` **17** — `od-era.css`, six era presets, colour cabinets sit in a play-room, themed placeholder covers). Atmosphere is `z-index: -1`; rail/topbar stack at 2, main at 1 (flattened `#admin-app-root` cannot). | Theme tree CSS/JS/tokens → **library volume** | After 2026-08-26: rebuild **and** **Reset Default Themes** — without Reset, member/admin chrome stays a flat colour slab and the Preferences picker is still the tiny swatch grid. After 2026-08-28: restart so `od-era.css` stacking copies; Reset if a preset still hides admin chrome |
| Libraries & scans hang + flatten (`GENERATOR_VERSION` **18** — `admin_manage_scanjobs.js` / `.css`: skip overlapping/hidden-tab polls; drop nested glass on jobs/unmatched; unwrap Libraries `.card`) | Theme tree CSS/JS → **library volume** | After 2026-08-30: rebuild **and** **Reset Default Themes** — without Reset, Scan management still polls drain-on-every-tick from stale JS and still shows cards-in-cards. Admin SPA poll coalesce ships in the image, not the theme volume. |
| Discover top-bar fade (`GENERATOR_VERSION` **19** — `od-shell.css` / `od-era.css`: bar opacity transition on tile hover instead of a z-index pop) | Theme tree CSS → **library volume** | After 2026-08-30 Discover pickup: rebuild **and** **Reset Default Themes**. Member shelf JS/CSS still needs a **member-app dist** rebuild — Reset Themes does not refresh that. |
| Libraries & scans in-place poll (`GENERATOR_VERSION` **21** — `admin_manage_scanjobs.js` + `scanJobsDom.js`: patch job progress instead of wiping the table; unmatched rebuild only on that pane. `od-shell.css`: account dropdown panel is a vertical menu on admin too) | Theme tree JS/CSS → **library volume** | After 2026-08-31 hang + account-menu pickup: rebuild **and** **Reset Default Themes**. Admin SPA `AdminTopNav.css` also needs the **admin-app** image rebuild. |
| Catalog / Discover tile hover (`GENERATOR_VERSION` **22** — `components.css` + `od-shell.css`: outline only while enlarged, tight to the cover; library L/R overlap via clip-margin, not inward origin) | Theme tree CSS → **library volume** | After 2026-08-31 tile-outline pickup: rebuild **and** **Reset Default Themes**. Member SPA `GameGrid.css` / `glass.css` / `NewsCard.css` still need a **member-app dist** rebuild. |
| Libraries & scans page-shell flatten + Libraries DataTable (`GENERATOR_VERSION` **23** — shell/tab-content flatten; admin SPA Libraries panel + Libraries/Scan unfurls) | Theme tree CSS/JS/templates → **library volume**; admin-app dist in **image** | After 2026-08-31: rebuild **and** **Reset Default Themes**. |
| Member selection top bar (`od-shell.css` — keep bar visible while `.is-selecting`; larger hover clip-margin; tighter top-bar start padding) | Theme tree CSS → **library volume**; selection bar logic in **member-app** dist | After 2026-08-31 pickup: rebuild **and** **Reset Default Themes**. |
| Thin top-bar no fade (`GENERATOR_VERSION` **24** — `od-shell.css` / `od-era.css`: bar stays opaque; hover lifts the scroll pane so tiles overlap it) | Theme tree CSS → **library volume** | Rebuild **and** **Reset Default Themes**. |
| Admin trail Reset layout (`GENERATOR_VERSION` **25** — `od-appbar.css`: no rest border on `.od-topbar__trail > .od-cbtn-group > .od-cbtn`) | Theme tree CSS → **library volume**; Dashboard drag/resize pitch is **admin-app** dist | Rebuild **and** **Reset Default Themes**. |
| Token pass on classic CSS (`od-tokens.css` family marks, scan jobs / game details / base / account / setup, plus earlier form-components / sidebar / table-components) | Theme tree CSS → **library volume** | After UID-017: **Reset Default Themes** so volume copies pick up `var(--od-radius-*)` / `var(--od-font-*)` / `--od-family-*`. Member SPA pages ship in **`member-app` dist** — rebuild the image; Reset Themes does not refresh those |

If a fresh Unraid pull looks half-applied (new play-skins room art shows but admin still looks old, or vice versa), check which of the two you skipped.

## Apply a theme

**Preferences is the only theme picker.** Everyone — admins included — chooses a theme in
**Preferences**, which sets colour theme, icon pack, font and tile size together. The picker
is grouped **Decade rooms** / **Colour cabinets** / **Installed** with a miniature of the
era room on each card, so fifteen-plus presets stay scannable.

> **Changed 2026-08-16.** The Admin → Themes page used to carry its own swatch grid writing the same
> `current_user.preferences.theme` that Preferences writes, so the two surfaces could disagree about
> what was selected with nothing to say which had won. The grid, its fetch and **`POST /admin/themes/apply`**
> are retired at every layer; a script or bookmark calling that endpoint will 404. Preferences builds
> its list from `get_installed_themes()`, so it already covers uploaded packs as well as presets.

Admin → Themes keeps the operator-only actions: **upload**, **Reset Default Themes**, **delete**, and
the Loading-icons controls below. It links to Preferences for the actual choice. Admins can also run
**Reset Default Themes** from Preferences → Look & density (same `POST /admin/themes/reset`).

Icon-pack fallback is unchanged: when a theme is selected and no pack is named, the theme's
`theme.json` `default_icon_pack` applies when present; otherwise the existing preference pack stands
(new rows still default to `outline`).

Never edit `oneirodex/static/library/themes/` in git — it is runtime output. Change `oneirodex/setup/default_theme/` and bump generator version when output format changes.

## Icon packs (separate from color themes)

Icon / image packs live under `static/library/icon-themes/{id}/` and are installed from `oneirodex/setup/icon_themes/` on boot. They restyle `.od-icon` via `html[data-icon-pack]` and work with **any** color theme.

- **Reset Default Themes does not wipe icon packs.**
- Members pick a pack in Preferences → Icon pack (same modal as color swatches).
- Details: [preferences-themes.md](../user/preferences-themes.md)

## Loading icons (admin)

Household spinner mode is **DB settings**, not theme volume files — Reset Themes does not change it. Motif CSS/JS **do** live on the theme volume (`od-loading-motifs.css` / `od_loading_motifs.js`) — Reset after Wave 2d so Auto Scan picks them up.

- Admin UI: **Admin → Themes → Loading icons** (rotate catalogue vs lock to one).
- Admin API: `PUT /api/admin/loading-icon/config` (`loading_icon_mode` = `rotate` \| `lock`, optional `loading_icon_id`).
- Public bootstrap: `GET /api/loading-icon`.
- Details: [settings-modules.md](settings-modules.md#loading-icons-admin-lock--rotate).
