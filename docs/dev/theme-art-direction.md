# Theme art direction

> Human, 2026-08-31: *"themes are horrible; need full design with AI artwork, not

## What a theme is

A theme is not a hue. It is six things that have to agree:

| Layer | Owned by | Where it lives |
|---|---|---|
| **Palette** — accent, surface, text, border | the preset | `css/od-tokens.css`, generated per preset |
| **Geometry** — radius, spacing, type scale, shadow, motion | the preset | same file; `_system_geometry()` in `preset_themes.py` |
| **Room** — the space the product sits in | the **era**, not the preset | `css/od-era.css` variables + `art/era/<era>.svg` |
| **Marks** — cover placeholder, avatars | the preset | `avatars/*.svg`, recoloured per preset; `.od-cover-fallback` is CSS + live text |
| **Motifs** — loading animations | shared, tinted | `css/od-loading-motifs.css`, `currentColor` throughout |
| **Glyphs** — rail and chrome icons | the icon pack the preset names | `icon_pack` on the preset |

Fifteen presets map onto **six eras**. That is deliberate: a room is a setting,
and several colour languages can live in one. Arcade Neon and Hot Cabinet are
both *in the arcade*; they are not two arcades.

## The rule that keeps rooms from becoming nine copies of one room

**The room keeps its own palette. Only the light the product makes is themed.**

A wood den is brown because dens were brown. Tinting the whole scene to the
preset accent is exactly what made the pre-37 gradient rooms read as one room
nine times. So each `art/era/*.svg` is authored in its era's palette, with a
single sentinel colour — `#2fd67b` — used *only* where the theme should show
through: the screen glow, a standby LED, a boombox bar. `_write_preset_era_art()`
substitutes that one value with the preset's `--od-accent`, exactly as
`_write_preset_avatars()` does for the three avatar colours.

Anyone authoring or generating room art works inside that contract:

- era palette for the world, `#2fd67b` for anything that should follow the theme;
- `viewBox="0 0 1600 900"`, `preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid slice"`, composed so
  the **bottom centre** survives cropping (the layer is `background-position:
  center bottom` under a UI that occupies the middle of the screen);
- no photographs, no manufacturer marks, no licensed art — original geometry
  that *reads* as a console, a cabinet, a CRT, without being anyone's product;
- quiet. This is backdrop. Anything with hard contrast in the centre fights the
  catalogue grid that sits on top of it.

## How a room is drawn

`#od-era-atmosphere` (see `templates/partials/era_atmosphere.html`) stacks, back
to front: `wall` → **`scene`** → `window` → `posters` → `furnish` → `stand` →
`floor` → `lamp` → `vignette` → `grain`. The gradient layers are the *light*;
`scene` is the *furniture*. Both stay: the gradients respond to tokens and
animate cheaply, the scene gives the room objects to be a room with.

`--od-era-scene` points at `../art/era/<era>.svg` — relative to the stylesheet,
so it resolves inside **the preset's own folder** and each preset paints its own
recoloured copy with no generator work per URL. `--od-era-scene-opacity` is
per-era, because a bright arcade and a dim den do not need the same weight.

## Replacing drawn art with generated art

The generated-art half of THEME-AI (SD.Next sidecar, `docker-compose.artwork-local.yml`,
the RTX 2080 box — **do not batch FLUX there, 8 GB**) drops a rendered backdrop
at the same path with the same name. Nothing else changes: no CSS, no generator,
no template. Requirements for a generated backdrop are the contract above, plus:

- deliver a raster at 1600×900 or larger, or an SVG that traces it;
- keep the accent-bearing element (screen, LED) as a separate pass in `#2fd67b`
  so the substitution still works, **or** accept that the room will not follow
  the theme accent;
- bump `GENERATOR_VERSION` so every preset rebuilds and operators Reset Themes.

## Deploy trap

Theme CSS, JS and art are served from the **library volume**, not the image.
A change here is invisible until the container is rebuilt **and** an admin runs
**Reset Themes** (Preferences → Look & density, admin only). `GENERATOR_VERSION`
is what makes that reset actually regenerate rather than keep the stale copy.

## Still open

- **E1** console-named theme packs (a pack per system family, not per decade).
- ~~**E2** loading motifs in full colour per console~~ — **done.** They are
  still `currentColor`, which was the right mechanism all along; what was
  missing is that `.od-loading-motif` read `--od-accent` instead of
  `--od-platform-accent`, so a Mega Drive cabinet span in the theme accent like
  everything else. `platformSkins` already sets that variable on `<html>` per
  system family, and the fallback keeps every non-system page unchanged.
- ~~**E4** per-theme rail glyph drawings~~ — **partly done.** The glyphs are one
  shared module now (`frontend/shared/src/railIcons.tsx`) instead of two copies
  that had already drifted by a glyph, and they respond to the icon-pack tokens
  (`--od-icon-stroke`, `--od-icon-linecap`, `--od-icon-fill`) a preset already
  sets — which is per-theme treatment without redrawing twenty-three paths per
  theme. Genuinely *redrawn* per-era glyph sets remain open.
- `platformSkins` is still duplicated member↔admin; `railIcons` no longer is.
- Generated (AI) backdrops for the six rooms, per the section above.
