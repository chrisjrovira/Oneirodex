 *   bar two  — what can I do here   (views, filters, page actions)
 *
 * Two overflows answering two different questions is correct. Two overflows
 * answering the same one was the thing worth fixing.
 *
 * Groups are derived from `getMoreLinks` rather than duplicating it, so a link
 * added there can never go missing here.
