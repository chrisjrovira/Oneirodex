/**
 * Twelve topics is a strip you scroll, not a switcher you read (W29 human
 * report: "help buttons are overflowing"). They collapse to five groups.
 *
 * Grouped rather than merged, deliberately. Merging the twelve into five
 * sections would have folded twelve headings and their summaries into five and
 * — worse — retired ten anchor ids that are linked from elsewhere in the
 * product: `playHonesty.js` sends a blocked Play straight to `/help#browser-play`.
 * Every section keeps its id, its heading and its own copy; only the switcher
 * is shorter, and a group jumps to the first section in it.
 *
 * `tone` is one of the five semantic colours the theme guarantees — accent,
 * info, success, warning, danger (see od-tokens.css). It is not decoration for
 * its own sake: twelve identical grey panels give the eye nothing to navigate
 * by, so a section is found by re-reading every heading. Colour plus a glyph
 * makes "the one about downloads" findable at a glance, and taking both from
 * the token set means every theme and icon pack restyles them for free rather
 * than fighting a palette invented here.
