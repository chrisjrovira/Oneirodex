/**
 * Height of one virtual row — the tiles only, no gap.
 *
 * The gap deliberately is *not* here. It used to be, and it was the third of
 * three places the same gap was counted:
 *
 *   1. this estimate returned `tileWidth * 4/3 + gap`
 *   2. GameGrid passes `gap` to the virtualizer, which spaces rows itself
 *   3. `.game-library-row` carried `padding-bottom: var(--od-tile-gap)`, and
 *      rows are measured with `virtualizer.measureElement`, so that padding
 *      landed in the measured height too
 *
 * Rows were therefore spaced roughly twice as far apart vertically as
 * horizontally, and — worse — a *measured* row and an *estimated* row differed
 * by a whole gap, so `getTotalSize()` shrank as rows came into view. The
 * container reserved height for the estimate, the tiles occupied less, and the
 * pagination bar sat below a band of nothing that grew with the tile-size
 * slider (the gap itself scales, 6px → 16px). That is the reported "empty space
 * above/below tiles" and "the section below the grid doesn't sit flush".
 *
 * One owner now: the virtualizer's own `gap` option. It puts the space
 * *between* rows and not after the last one, which is what a CSS grid `gap`
 * does and what makes the grid end flush with its final row.
 *
 * Cover is 3:4, so a row is the cover height plus `titleH` — the title strip
 * is a member preference, and a row that ignored it would leave the estimate
 * short of the measured height and reopen the drifting-total-size bug above.
