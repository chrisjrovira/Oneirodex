/**
 * Deep links into the Integrations page have to land somewhere (W27-A8).
 *
 * Every `/admin/integrations#<id>` in the nav was dead, in two separate ways,
 * and both failed silently — the browser finds no matching element, stays at
 * the top of the page, and the click looks like it did nothing:
 *
 *   1. The page rendered its only id on the heading, as `int-<id>`, while every
 *      link pointed at bare `#<id>`. That broke all nine at once.
 *   2. Five of the anchors named a provider with no section of its own at all
 *      (`#email`, `#indexers`, `#giantbomb`, `#hltb`, `#steamgriddb`), so they
 *      would still have missed once the prefix was fixed.
 *
 * A dead link is worse than an ugly one: it teaches people the nav is
 * unreliable. Nothing but a test catches this, because a wrong fragment is
 * valid HTML and throws no error.
