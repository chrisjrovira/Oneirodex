/**
 * A section landing page with no body of its own (GT-B35).
 *
 * The copy here used to read: "This admin surface runs in the React shell. Use
 * the actions above for the full workflow. Form POSTs still hit the existing
 * Flask endpoints." Two problems, one of them a dead end.
 *
 * There are no actions above. GT-B7 deleted the per-page `LinkRow` when the
 * rail took over destinations, so the sentence pointed at controls that had
 * been removed — and this is precisely the page with nothing else on it, so an
 * operator following that instruction found blank space. The second sentence
 * described the app's internal wiring, which is not something an operator can
 * act on and not something they should have to read.
 *
 * `links` is how it stops being a dead end. Passing a section's destinations is
 * *not* the LinkRow mistake returning: LinkRow put a duplicate nav on top of
 * every page that already had content. Here the list is the entire purpose of
 * the page, and it is also the only route to those destinations when the rail
 * is a closed drawer on a narrow screen.
