 * without first asking the server what that reset would empty, and it shows
 * that answer — including tables reached by cascade — before the confirm field
 * is even usable. The alternative, a button that describes itself, is how an
 * operator ends up clearing something the wording did not cover.
 *
 * The one promise worth repeating everywhere it can be read: this never deletes
 * files. Scanned games, artwork and firmware live on disk and are not touched.
 * The server enforces that by having no filesystem access in the reset path at
 * all — see oneirodex/utils/system_reset.py — so this is a description of a
 * guarantee rather than a claim the UI is making on its own.
