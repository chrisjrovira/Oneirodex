// Barrel for `@oneirodex/ui` — the one home for infrastructure the three SPAs
// (member-app, admin-app, ops-glance) all need.
//
// Wave B1.1 made `frontend/shared` a valid npm workspace package. Wave B1.2
// moves the real implementations here — one canonical copy of each module that
// had drifted into 2-3 divergent copies across the SPAs — and repoints every
// consumer onto `import { X } from '@oneirodex/ui'`.
//
// Phase 3.3 converted the package to TypeScript (`strict: true`); the exports
// carry types now and a consuming SPA's bundler compiles the source directly.
//
// Behavioural rule when copies diverged: the superset wins, so consolidating
// widens the narrow copies and narrows none.
